**A website about software, computers, open source, pigeons, blockchain, deep learning, neuroscience, ethology and everything in between!**

Not sure what this website is supposed to be, do you even need your personal webspace in times of Facebook, Twitter, Medium & Co.?
I think the answer is *MAYBE*...

It might be cool to have a space to reference our talks, blog posts, publications and other things we want to share with the world. 

The title of our site **p1g30nh4ck** is supposed to be a portmanteau word of *pigeonshack* and *hack* written in *leetspeak*, smart and funny!
