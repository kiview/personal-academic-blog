title: Birds of a feather flock together - Tracking pigeons with Python and OpenCV
event: PyCon DE & PyData Berlin
event_url: https://programm.javaland.eu/2020/#/scheduledEvent/590937
location: Berlin, Germany
summary: Tracking pigeons with cool OSS CV software.
abstract: "In this talk, I want to show how to easily integrate existing Open Source technologies, such as Python, OpenCV, Seaborn and Jupyter in order to track the movement of pigeons in a labyrinth. I also want to encourage scientists without a computer science background to get in touch with the Open Source mindset."
