title: Tracking Pigeons with OpenCV and DeepLearning
event: JavaLand 2020
event_url: https://programm.javaland.eu/2020/#/scheduledEvent/590937
location: Br√ºhl, Germany
summary: Tracking pigeons with cool OSS CV software.
abstract: "In this talk I want to show how to easily integrate existing Open Source technologies, such as Python, OpenCV, Seaborn and Jupyter in order to track the movement of pigeons in a labyrinth. As an additional outlook I will showcase the state-of-the-art and Open Source deep learning toolbox DeepLabCut that can be used for markerless pose estimation of animals performing various tasks"
