PhD student at the biopsychology department of the Ruhr University Bochum. Focusing on pigeonsâ€™ consciousness and self-recognition. While doing behavioural experiments, she also explores challenging analyzing methods and the field of data science. 

That is also one of the reasons why she is interested in open-source technology (especially Python) which helps her to not get lost in the thorny paths and thick forests of scientific computing that are ruled by gruesome beasts like Matlab.
